This site is a collection of *mostly* data-related resources I've found useful in my career.

[I work in data](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parker-tenpas-a45088134/). My experience includes time at the Harlow Center for Biological Psychology, the 2016 Clinton Presidential Campaign, a few years in ecommerce and healthtech startups, and most recently manufacturing at ~~Rivian~~ [Rivian and Volkswagen Group Technologies](https://rivianvw.tech/). Very different industries, always data.

I'm from Wisconsin where I dropped out of a PhD program at UW-Madison to work in tech. I escaped the midwestern winter by finding an internship at a mobile app startup in Honolulu, Hawaii. Afterwards I moved to NYC where I learned how to actually build stuff and left the concrete jungle to weather a pandemic from South Lake Tahoe, California. I now live in Denver, Colorado where I just might stay put for a while.
