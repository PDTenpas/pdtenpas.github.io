I'm originally from Oshkosh, Wisconsin and am currently hiding in the woods around Lake Tahoe.

This site is a collection of *mostly* data-related resources I've found useful in my career so far.

I work in data. Past experiences include time at the Harlow Center for Biological Psychology, the 2016 Clinton Presidential Campaign, a few years in ecommerce, and most recently, healthtech. Very different industries but always data.

I'm currently crunching numbers at [Headway](https://headway.co/).
