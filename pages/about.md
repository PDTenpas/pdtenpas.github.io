This site is a collection of *mostly* data-related resources I've found useful in my career.

[I work in data](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parker-tenpas-a45088134/). My experience includes time at the Harlow Center for Biological Psychology, the 2016 Clinton Presidential Campaign, a few years in ecommerce and healthtech startups, and most recently manufacturing engineering at [Rivian](https://rivian.com/). Very different industries but always data.

I'm originally from Wisconsin where I dropped out of a PhD program at UW-Madison to work in tech. I did my first internship in Honolulu, Hawaii because I wanted to be somewhere tropical. Afterwards I went to NYC where I learned how to build useful things and left the concrete jungle to weather the pandemic from South Lake Tahoe, California. I recently moved to Denver, Colorado where I plan to stay put for a while.

I'm not sure I'll ever regularly work from an open floor office ever again and that makes me quite happy.
