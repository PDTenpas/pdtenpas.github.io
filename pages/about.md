This site is a collection of *mostly* data-related resources I've found useful in my career so far.

[I work in data](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parker-tenpas-a45088134/). My past experiences include time at the Harlow Center for Biological Psychology, the 2016 Clinton Presidential Campaign, a few years in ecommerce, and most recently, healthtech startups. Very different industries but always data.

I'm originally from Wisconsin where I dropped out of a grad program at UW-Madison to focus on data. I did my first tech internship in Honolulu, Hawaii because I wanted to live somewhere tropical. Afterwards I went to NYC to cut my teeth and learn how to actually build useful things. I left NYC to weather the pandemic working from Lake Tahoe, and most recenty moved Denver, Colorado where I plan to stay put for a while.

I'm not sure I'll ever regularly work from an open floor office ever again and that makes me quite happy.
