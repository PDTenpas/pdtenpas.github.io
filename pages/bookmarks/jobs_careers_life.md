# Data Careers
Cheesy titles on some of these but the content is good.

[**Data Carpentry**](http://www.mimno.org/articles/carpentry/)

> I don’t know as much as I’d like about woodworking, but my impression is that it is not so much a single discipline as a vast array of specific skills. None of these are particularly difficult by themselves, but knowing which tool or method to use at each stage and carrying out each one cleanly and efficiently takes years of practice. Data carpentry, which I’ve been practicing in one way or another for about 15 years (though never as my official responsibility), is likewise not a single process but a thousand little skills and techniques.

[**A forty-year career**](https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/)

[**The Engineer/Manager Pendulum**](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/)

> I’ve done this a few times myself now; start out as an early or first infra engineering hire, build the stack, then build the team, then manage the team, then … leave and start it all over again. I get antsy, I get restless. I start to feel like I know what I’m doing (… a telltale sign something’s wrong).
> It’s a good cycle for people who like early stage companies, or have ADD. But I don’t see people talking about it as a career path. So I’m here to advocate for it, as an intentional and awesome way of life.

[**Data Science Foundations: Know your data. Really, really, know it**](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-foundations-know-your-data-really-really-know-it-a6bb97eb991c)

[**How to send progress updates**](https://www.spakhm.com/updates-howto)

> If you work on anything worthwhile, sooner or later people will care about it and will want you to send progress updates. These could be quarterly investor updates, weekly updates to your boss, emails to adjacent teams, etc. Here are tips on how to do this well.

# Your Career

[**Hamming, "You and Your Research" (June 6, 1995)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw)

- A phenomenal talk that goes beyond academic research and serves as a guide on how to do great work.

[**Cargo Cult Science: Some remarks on science, pseudoscience, and learning how to not fool yourself.**](http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm)

- Caltech’s 1974 commencement address.

> So I wish to you—I have no more time, so I have just one wish for you—the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity.  May you have that freedom.

[**How to Do Great Work**](http://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html)

> There are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules: to enjoy breaking them, and to be indifferent to them. I call these two cases being aggressively and passively independent-minded.

> The aggressively independent-minded are the naughty ones. Rules don't merely fail to stop them; breaking rules gives them additional energy. For this sort of person, delight at the sheer audacity of a project sometimes supplies enough activation energy to get it started.

[**Elitism as the Mid-Career Growth Engine**](https://stkbailey.substack.com/p/elitism-as-the-mid-career-growth)

> Technical excellence begins in wonder but is honed by disgust.

[**Strong Opinions, Weakly Held — a framework for thinking**](https://medium.com/@ameet/strong-opinions-weakly-held-a-framework-for-thinking-6530d417e364)

[**Skinner as Self-manager**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1284070/pdf/jaba003000300545.pdf)

[**Charlie Munger: The Psychology of Human Misjudgment**](https://fs.blog/great-talks/psychology-human-misjudgment//)

[**Speed matters: Why working quickly is more important than it seems**](http://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters)

> The prescription must be that if there’s something you want to do a lot of and get good at—like write, or fix bugs—you should try to do it faster.

[**There's No Speed Limit**](https://sive.rs/kimo)

> When the studio owner heard I was going to Berklee, he said, “I graduated from Berklee and taught there, too. I’ll bet I can teach you two years of theory and arranging in only a few lessons. I suspect you can graduate in two years if you understand there’s no speed limit.”

[**High Ownership, High Urgency**](https://blog.danielna.com/high-ownership-high-urgency/)

> The drive is internal: if something could be better, why shouldn’t it be better? If something could be faster, why shouldn’t it be faster?

[**Becoming a magician**](https://autotranslucence.wordpress.com/2018/03/30/becoming-a-magician/)

> One of my heuristics for growth is to seek out the magicians, and find the magic.

[**Liquid vs. Illiquid Careers**](https://www.everythingisatrolley.com/p/liquid-vs-illiquid-careers?)

> Just like in financial markets, some human capital is easier to price and trade than others. This is not about the absolute value of your skills or experience, but how easily the market can assess and exchange them.

[**How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You)**](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html)

[**The Gervais Principle: The Office According to The Office**](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/)

> The Office is not a random series of cynical gags aimed at momentarily alleviating the existential despair of low-level grunts. It is a fully realized theory of management that falsifies 83.8% of the business section of the bookstore.
