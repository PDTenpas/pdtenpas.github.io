# Data Platforms
Framing and Approaches

## Framing

[**Stevey's Google Platforms Rant**](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611)

> Start with a platform, then use it for everything...

[**Data architecture vs backend architecture**](https://erikbern.com/2019/01/10/data-architecture-vs-backend-architecture.html)

> I’ve found it useful to push as much as you can out of the backend into the data platform.

[**Data Systems Tend Towards Production**](https://ian-macomber.medium.com/data-systems-tend-towards-production-be5a86f65561)

> There are many reasons to worry about non-data team members writing logic in SQL and making dbt PRs. What I can guarantee — this logic will be written, and if the data team gatekeeps, it will be written outside of their visibility. If a data team can educate and encourage contributions to their codebase, they invite code to be written where it most belongs.

[**DataOps Principles: How Startups Do Data The Right Way**](https://retina.ai/blog/dataops-principles/)

> If it’s someone’s job to handle all data requests by writing a new SQL query or to downloading data from external systems, your team is headed in the wrong direction.

> Start with manual processes — like SQL queries or API pulls — to understand the problem space. Next, automate the repetitive parts and start manually monitoring that automation. Finally, automate the actions taken to correct issues found via monitoring and manually check performance metrics.

> Frequent small changes over infrequent large changes
