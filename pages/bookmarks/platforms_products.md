# Data Platforms
Framing and Approaches

## Framing

[**Data architecture vs backend architecture**](https://erikbern.com/2019/01/10/data-architecture-vs-backend-architecture.html)

> I’ve found it useful to push as much as you can out of the backend into the data platform.

[**A reference guide for fintech & small-data engineering**](https://medium.com/dangerous-engineering/a-reference-guide-for-fintech-small-data-engineering-bd65b9796d90)

- A more fitting title may be: A reference guide to impactful engineering work and the cultures that allow for it.

> Start with a platform, then use it for everything...

[**DataOps Principles: How Startups Do Data The Right Way**](https://retina.ai/blog/dataops-principles/)

> If it’s someone’s job to handle all data requests by writing a new SQL query or to downloading data from external systems, your team is headed in the wrong direction.

> Start with manual processes — like SQL queries or API pulls — to understand the problem space. Next, automate the repetitive parts and start manually monitoring that automation. Finally, automate the actions taken to correct issues found via monitoring and manually check performance metrics.

> Frequent small changes over infrequent large changes
