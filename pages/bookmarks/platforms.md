# Framing

[**Stevey's Google Platforms Rant**](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611)

> Start with a platform, then use it for everything...

[**Data architecture vs backend architecture**](https://erikbern.com/2019/01/10/data-architecture-vs-backend-architecture.html)

> I’ve found it useful to push as much as you can out of the backend into the data platform.

[**A reference guide for fintech & small-data engineering**](https://medium.com/dangerous-engineering/a-reference-guide-for-fintech-small-data-engineering-bd65b9796d90)

> In my time leading engineering teams at Square and Gusto I’ve found that this big-data approach to software engineering is a poor fit for many product companies. Rather, product scalability problems are along a different axis: Sprawling domains and massive schemas implementing those domains.

[**4 Pillars of Analytics**](https://medium.com/analytics-and-data/4-pillars-of-analytics-1ee79e2e5f5f)

> Acquire, Process, Surface, Act.

[**Research quality data and research quality databases**](https://simplystatistics.org/posts/2019-05-29-research-quality-data-and-research-quality-databases/)

> Creating research quality data is the way that you refine and structure data to make it conducive to doing science.

[**Data Systems Tend Towards Production**](https://ian-macomber.medium.com/data-systems-tend-towards-production-be5a86f65561)

> There are many reasons to worry about non-data team members writing logic in SQL and making dbt PRs. What I can guarantee — this logic will be written, and if the data team gatekeeps, it will be written outside of their visibility. If a data team can educate and encourage contributions to their codebase, they invite code to be written where it most belongs.

[**Choose Boring Technology**](http://boringtechnology.club/)

> I chose “boring technology” as the pithy SEO-friendly title for this content, and I regret it most days. It’s kind of distracting. “Boring sounds bad, why is he saying it’s good?” Et cetera. It’s a real shitshow.

> But what I’m aiming for there is not technology that’s “boring” the way CSPAN is boring. I mean that it’s boring in the sense that it’s well understood. It’s bad, but you know why it’s bad. You can list all of the main ways it will let you down.

[**DataOps Principles: How Startups Do Data The Right Way**](https://retina.ai/blog/dataops-principles/)

> If it’s someone’s job to handle all data requests by writing a new SQL query or to downloading data from external systems, your team is headed in the wrong direction.

[**Redefining Ownership**](https://cacrawford.org/posts/2022-02-24-redefining-ownership/)

> High-quality applications, however, must enable ownership. They must be cognizant of their customers’ ever-expanding needs and plan accordingly so that customers can solve their own problems.

[**Towards an understanding of technical debt**](https://kellanem.com/notes/towards-an-understanding-of-technical-debt)

[**Scientific Debt**](http://varianceexplained.org/r/scientific-debt/)

> Scientific debt is when a team takes shortcuts in data analysis, experimental practices, and monitoring that could have long-term negative consequences.

# Building

[**Tidy Data**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html)

> The principles of tidy data provide a standard way to organize data values within a dataset.

[**The Quartz guide to bad data**](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide)

> An exhaustive reference to problems seen in real-world data along with suggestions on how to resolve them.

[**Joel Grus' I Don't Like Notebooks (talk)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U)

[**Whom the Gods Would Destroy, They First Give Real-time Analytics**](https://mcfunley.com/whom-the-gods-would-destroy-they-first-give-real-time-analytics)

> Every few months, I try to talk someone down from building a real-time product analytics system. When I’m lucky, I can get to them early.
