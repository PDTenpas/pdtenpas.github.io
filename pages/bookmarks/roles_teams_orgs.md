## Culture

[**Build a Team that Ships**](https://nav.al/build-a-team-that-ships)

> Imagine calling someone on the phone, going hello! then putting them on hold...

# Organizations

[**Simple sabotage for software**](https://erikbern.com/2023/12/13/simple-sabotage-for-software)

> Let's say you were employed as a CTO behind the front lines and you wanted to destroy productivity for as long as you can without getting caught.
