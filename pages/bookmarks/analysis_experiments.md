# Data Analysis
Framing and Approaches

## Framing

[**Tukey, Design Thinking, and Better Questions**](https://simplystatistics.org/2019/04/17/tukey-design-thinking-and-better-questions/)

> In my view, the most useful thing a data scientist can do is to devote serious effort towards improving the quality and sharpness of the question being asked.

[**Oversimplify**](http://brohrer.github.io/oversimplify.html)

[**Trustworthy Data Analysis**](https://simplystatistics.org/2018/06/04/trustworthy-data-analysis/)

> It’s entirely possible to trust an analysis but not believe the final conclusions.

[**Data-Informed Product Building**](https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/data-informed-product-building-1e509a5c4112)

> Our goal is to give you an understanding of how a product evolves from infancy to maturity; a holistic sense of the product metric ecosystem of growth, engagement and monetization; a framework to define goals for your company; and a toolkit you can use to analyze your product’s performance against those goals.

## Statistical Significance Pitfalls

> Our key point here is that it is possible to have multiple potential comparisons, in the sense of a data analysis whose details are highly contingent on data, without the researcher performing any conscious procedure of fishing or examining multiple p-values.
