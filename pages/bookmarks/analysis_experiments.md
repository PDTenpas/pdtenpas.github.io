# Data Analysis
Framing, Cleaning, Approaches

## Framing

[**Tukey, Design Thinking, and Better Questions**](https://simplystatistics.org/2019/04/17/tukey-design-thinking-and-better-questions/)

> In my view, the most useful thing a data scientist can do is to devote serious effort towards improving the quality and sharpness of the question being asked.

[**Trustworthy Data Analysis**](https://simplystatistics.org/2018/06/04/trustworthy-data-analysis/)

> It’s entirely possible to trust an analysis but not believe the final conclusions.

[**20 Questions to Ask Prior to Starting Data Analysis**](https://towardsdatascience.com/20-questions-to-ask-prior-to-starting-data-analysis-6ec11d6a504b)

[**Research Design Patterns**](http://pgbovine.net/research-design-patterns.htm)

[**Data-Informed Product Building**](https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/data-informed-product-building-1e509a5c4112)

> Our goal is to give you an understanding of how a product evolves from infancy to maturity; a holistic sense of the product metric ecosystem of growth, engagement and monetization; a framework to define goals for your company; and a toolkit you can use to analyze your product’s performance against those goals.

## Approaches

[**Conversion rates – you are (most likely) computing them wrong**](https://erikbern.com/2017/05/23/conversion-rates-you-are-most-likely-computing-them-wrong.html)

[**Modeling conversion rates and saving millions of dollars using Kaplan-Meier and gamma distributions**](https://better.engineering/2019/07/29/modeling-conversion-rates-and-saving-millions-of-dollars-using-kaplan-meier-and-gamma-distributions/)

[**Markov Chains Explained Visually**](http://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/)

> A Markov chain tells you the probability of hopping, or "transitioning," from one state to any other state

[**Forecasting at scale**](https://peerj.com/preprints/3190/)

[**ML beyond Curve Fitting: An Intro to Causal Inference and do-Calculus**](https://www.inference.vc/untitled/)

> Causal inference and do-calculus allows you to understand a problem and establish what needs to be estimated from data based on your assumptions captured in a causal diagram.

# Experimentation

Framing, Approaches, Significance Pitfalls

## Framing

[**Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach stats)**](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/)

## Approaches

[**Mediation Modeling at Uber: Understanding Why Product Changes Work (and Don’t Work)**](https://eng.uber.com/mediation-modeling/)

> Mediation modeling goes beyond simple cause and effect relationships in an attempt to understand what underlying mechanisms led to a result.

## Statistical Significance Pitfalls

[**The garden of forking paths: Why multiple comparisons can be a problem, even when there is no “fishing expedition” or “p-hacking” and the research hypothesis was posited ahead of time**](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf)

> Our key point here is that it is possible to have multiple potential comparisons, in the sense of a data analysis whose details are highly contingent on data, without the researcher performing any conscious procedure of fishing or examining multiple p-values.

> Decrease your confidence about most things if you’re not sure that you’ve investigated every piece of evidence.
